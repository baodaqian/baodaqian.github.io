Welcome to my page! The last time I update this page is June 7th, 2025. This page is still under construction (hence you may notice a lot of different bugs and incomplete stuff) and please come back for more updates!

My name is Daqian Bao, and I am a Ph.D. student in Machine Learning (ML) at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). As a PhD student, I am very fortunate to be able to work with Dr. [Justin Romberg](https://jrom.ece.gatech.edu/) as his advisee.

My research is currently focused on two different fields:
- The multimodal sensing method for 3D reconstructions.
  - For multimodal sensing methods, I am currently working on combining traditional 3D reconstruction algorithms with radar signal processing models to generate 3D rendering in reasonable speed. Although the computation is potentially slower for radar, it is more robust against poor visibility. 
- AI for Science.
  - I am working on using simple machine learning model for compression of radar signal processing application. I will share more details when it is appropriate to do so.
- Spectral properties of optimization algorithms for compression.
  - I will provide more update when the time is appropriate.

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I earned my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Tech. During my Master's degree, I worked on the intersection between ML and partial differential equations (PDE). I had a very pleasant and productive time with Dr. [Ali Adibi](https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/ali-adibi). The research mainly included:
- AI for Science.
  - I used Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) in the design of metasurfaces using Helmholtz's equation.

I earned my B.S. degrees in Applied Math and Material Science and Engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I spent two years on the research of semiconductor materials. It was a very fun and intriguing experience.

I am always open to discussing research and potential collaborations. Please feel free to reach out.
