Welcome to my page! It is currently under construction and please come back for updates. Thank you!

My name is Daqian Bao, and I am a Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at the Georgia Institute of Technology. As a PhD student, I am very fortunate to be able to work with Dr. [Justin Romberg](https://jrom.ece.gatech.edu/)

My research is currently focused on the multimodal sensing method for 3D reconstructions. 

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I earned my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Tech and my B.S. degrees in Applied Math and Material Science and Engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

I am always open to discussing research and potential collaborations. Please feel free to reach out.
